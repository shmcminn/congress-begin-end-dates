# Congress Begin and End Dates

This repo contains a [.csv](congress-begin-end-dates.csv) and [.json](congress-begin-end-dates.json) file with beginning and end dates for each session of Congress, all sourced to [this page](https://www.senate.gov/reference/Sessions/sessionDates.htm) on the Senate's website. 

Take note that the dates before 1900 are (for now) written in a different date formate because of the way Excel handles old dates.
